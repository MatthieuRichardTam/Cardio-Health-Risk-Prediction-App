# Heart Health Risk Prediction App

## Description
This is a user-friendly web application developed using Streamlit to help users:

1. **Predict the Risk of Heart Disease**: Based on medical details entered by the user, the app predicts whether the user is at risk of heart disease using a trained machine learning model.
2. **Visualize Data**: Explore interactive charts and visualizations created from historical heart disease patient data.

## Features

### 1. Home
- Overview of the app's purpose and functionalities.
- A welcoming interface with a brief description of the dataset.

### 2. Data Exploration
- **Dataset Overview**:
  - Summary statistics and feature descriptions.
  - Data type analysis and distribution insights.
- **Interactive Visualizations**:
  - Histograms, pie charts, scatter plots, and box plots.
  - Outlier detection and correlation heatmaps.

### 3. Risk Prediction
- Input fields for medical attributes (e.g., age, cholesterol, blood pressure).
- Predicts the likelihood of heart disease (High Risk or Low Risk).
- Displays probability scores with clear recommendations.

## How to Run the App

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python installed (version >= 3.8). Install the required libraries by running:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the App
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_directory>
   ```
2. Launch the Streamlit application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
3. Open the app in your browser (default: http://localhost:8501).

## File Structure
- `app.py`: Main application file managing navigation between sections.
- `data_exp.py`: Handles the **Data Exploration** section, including visualizations.
- `risk_predic.py`: Implements the **Risk Prediction** logic and user input handling.
- `heart.csv` & `renamed_heart.csv`: Dataset files for analysis and predictions.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists all dependencies for the project.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+disease). It includes attributes such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, and chest pain types to evaluate heart health.
